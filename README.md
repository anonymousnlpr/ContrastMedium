#<b>Description</b>
CM is an algorithm that transforms noisy semantic networks into full-fledged, clean taxonomies. CM is able to identify the embedded taxonomy structure from a noisy knowledge graph without explicit human supervision, e.g., a set of manually selected input root and leaf concepts. This is achieved by leveraging structural information from a companion reference taxonomy, to which the input knowledge graph is linked (either automatically or manually). When used in conjunction with un-supervised methods for hypernym acquisition and knowledge base linking, our methodology provides a complete solution for end-to-end taxonomy induction. Our experiments using CM on automatically acquired knowledge graphs, as well as a SemEval benchmark, achieved good re sults.

#<b>Source Code</b>
The source code provided here allows to perform the ContrastMedium algorithm with two toy simple noisy graph.
